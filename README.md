# Triple-Triad_AI

Triple triad game first appeared on Final Fantasy VIII.  In the game two players 
face off against one another, one side playing as "yellow", the other as "red" on a 3x3 grid.
Each player has five cards in a hand and the aim is to capture the opponent's cards by turning them into 
the player's own color of yellow or red.

The build includes a simple AI system. Computer will always try to beat player's card with one card in its deck,
if not possible it will use a random card.
